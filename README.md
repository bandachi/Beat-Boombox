This project was made purely on android studio for the Hack The 90s hackathon.

Sprites and all images were made by @bandachi 

Description:
Greetings bodacious Boombox. You were chosen by urban teens to unite their scattered peoples.
Oh mighty Boombox, you were first made in 1966 by Philips .
You were popular from 1970 to the late 1990s, until the rise of more compact audio playback devices like the walkman.
Oh loud and robust Boombox, hipsters wish for your rise own once more and require a device of unparalleled style!
Will you answer their call? Will you build an industry that stands the test of time?

Swipe the screen to direct sound waves to destroy the onslaught of walkmans. 
Every walkman destroyed adds 90 to your score. 
Don't let the walkmans reach you or you'll lose health. Lose all your health and you lose the game.
